                <p class="ways">Global logistics underpins development and growth. 
                    An endless choreography of goods and services, it supports our economies, our partnerships,
                     our ways of life. But when the connections become weak, 
                     so does our ability to grow, and thrive, together.
                     At Maersk, our vision is to transform the flow of the foods, goods, 
                     data and materials that sustain people, businesses and economies the world over. 
                     To enable the exchange of ideas, 
                     culture and trust for a truly integrated world where value is created for everyone.
